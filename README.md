# MyReads Project

Final project of 'Fundamentos de React' from Udacitys Nanodegree course "Desenvolvedor React". The main goal of this project was to make
a booklist making possible for the user to add a new book from a given API and put it on one of the three shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to read" and "Read". In order to make a little more than i was asked for, I implemented a snackbar that allows the user to 'undo'
his last change easily and a cool loading spinner.

Enjoy!
